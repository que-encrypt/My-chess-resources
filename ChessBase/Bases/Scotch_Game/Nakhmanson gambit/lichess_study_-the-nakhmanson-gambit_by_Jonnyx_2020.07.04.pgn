{ You can watch the introduction as a video aswell: https://youtu.be/BfazYNnRXDA Welcome to my study about the Nakhmanson Gambit! The Nakhmanson Gambit is a chess opening for white that can be reached in several move orders, but is mainly assigned to the Italian Game. In the gambit white is willing to temporarily give up two minor pieces to open up the position, getting an ultra fast development and weakening blacks king. The opening is quite famous in online blitz games because for an unprepared opponent it's nearly unpossible to survive the attack if he accepts the gambit. Truth must be told the Nakhmanson Gambit is only a rare guest in over the board tournament games because black has some decent ways to decline the gambit. Recently the Nakhmanson Gambit got quite some attention because Jonathan Schrantz played it several times on his twitch channel Vampirechicken. So a big shout out to him for his work!

I divided the study into four theoretical parts, that are backed up by some tactical exercises. First I will show you the absolute mainline of the Nakhmanson Gambit, when black accepts the gambit and will bring his king back to e8. In part two of the study I will show you the engine line 8...Kf6. I doubt that you will ever get it in a practical game because its to risky to play for a human without an engine, but we still should take brief a look at the line because it's the engines favourite. In part three I will show you the main variations to decline the gambit 6... Nxc3. If white will find the best moves, then he will be up a pawn in the end. But due to the fact that rookendings often tend to be a draw, I think white will have drawing chances. I will also cover the move 6...d5 in the video that is quite common even if it's not dangerous for white. In the fourth part I'll show you 6...Nd6. The move isn't that famous for black yet, but it scores incredible well and the engine likes the move as much as 6...Nxc3. Even the IM Georgios Souleidis, also known as The Big Greek, is giving the 6...Nd6 line as his recommandation against the Nakhmanson Gambit, so we really have to cover it.

The opening itself is quite tactical that's why I included some puzzles after each theoretical part. I hope that they will help you to sharpen your tactical vision in the Nakhmanson Gambit.

{ You can watch the analyse of this chapter as a video aswell: https://youtu.be/AQv5gW9WfeE In this chapter I will present you the mainline of the Nakhmanson Gambit 8... Ke8. We will find out that in the lines that look most human white will often gain a decisive attack. But truth must be told, with best play black can get away with a draw. Anyway I would doubt that many opponents will find the best defending moves because most of them look pretty ugly to a human eye. }

{ You can watch the analyse of this chapter as a video aswell: https://youtu.be/Xcur4I0b_N8 In this chapter I will show you what will happen if black accepts the Nakhmanson Gambit and plays 8... Kf6. This move is the engines favorite and if black finds some more only moves, he will remain beeing a pawn up in a slightly better position. But truth must be told, I don't think that this variation is a practical way of playing for black because most of the moves are pretty hard to find for a human without the help of an engine. And even if black prepares the line with the computer, white only needs to play a single different move and black is out of book in a position where blacks king stands in the middle of a war. }

I also saw the first videos by good chessplayers like IM The Big Greek and GM Niclas Huschenbeth who recommend the move for black, so I had to cover it in this video series.
