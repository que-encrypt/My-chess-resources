{ The Nakhmanson Gambit is one of the most aggressive lines that white can take in the Italian Game. White looks to give up two pawns and a knight in exchange for rapid development and some deadly attacks on the black king. The opening usually starts with the moves: }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Nc3 { For this overview we will be looking the accepted lines after } 6... dxc3 7. Bxf7+ Kxf7 8. Qd5+ { In this line white has given up two pawns, a knight, and now a bishop all for the thrill of a devastating attack on the black king.
In this position the black king has to move. We will cover each of the moves for the king. } *

{ The most common line for black in the Nakhmanson Gambit is to take with their pawn with 6…dxc3 but here we will look at what happens if they take with their knight 6…Nxc3 }

{ Your opponent won’t always accept your gambits. It’s important to understand how to continue your attack if they do decide to decline. There are many declined lines you might see in the Nakhmanson Gambit. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Nc3 { The main thing that white needs to consider when playing the declined lines of the Nakhmanson Gambit is to stay aggressive. If white trades down and doesn’t continue to attack, black will have the upper hand with little risk of losing the game } *

This is a common way for white to attack the king side for black. If they try to stop the attack with Ne5, that loses to Re1. If black tries to play Nd5, blocking the bishop, then white can play Qf3 with a strong attack. } *
